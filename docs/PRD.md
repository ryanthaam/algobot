## 🔬 ML Integration: Random Forest Classifier

AlgoBot uses a trained Random Forest model to evaluate setup quality before execution.

### Feature Inputs:
- Candle body/volume ratios
- RSI, volatility (ATR)
- Distance from liquidity zone
- Structure shift boolean
- Risk-reward profile

Only trades with high predicted success probability (e.g., >70%) are executed.
